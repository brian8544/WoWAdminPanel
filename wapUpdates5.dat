[Fury 255 Fun]You may use SOME hacks here but notice, that over-using hacks like speed and fly will get you banned - they can detect things but only if used heavily
If you find yourself get "disconnected" once, twice, stop hacking,lower your profile, you're already busted and the next time it'll be a ban.[/Fury 255 Fun

[Hellscream]There are two different servers running a realm called Hellscream:

Hellscream-wow.com - hellscream-wow have an active anti cheat which will disable your hacks.
Flying is rather impossible, but you can speed hack up to +50% of your speed. so if your'e on foot for example, set speed to maximum of 11 or so to run at 150%+- without being caught.
Teleports also dont work for long distances, but XYZ teleporation works if you need it.

Molten-Wow.com - DETECTED on molten - avoid using hacks at the moment ! the radar tracking is fine, but all speed altering \ teleportations are detectable !

[Unlimited 255 PvE]Heroes-WoW (Unlimited x255)
====================

On heroes wow some hacks are detectable some are not.
1. Flying - impossible, it automaticly kills you, don't bother with this. instead, you can use No-Falling combined with the XYZ Moving feature, this will grant you semi-flying experience.

2. Jump++ will get detected after the 3rd jump.

Also, notice some players reported Walk-On-Water as detectable.

There was also a period teleports and speedhack got checked serer-side but it seems that limitation been removed.
[/Unlimited 255 PvE]
[HellGround]If you're playing on HellGround (2.4.3):
======================

Flying hack is detectable, and gets turned off the moment you activate it.
If you still want to Fly there, and risk it, you can do that by activating the Flying speed Lock,
along with the Flying Speed. this will get you Airborn, but its a bit buggy.
also, i suggest you set Timer interval to 50-100 to maximize locking.

Same goes for Walk-On-Water, lower timer interval to 50 or so, to make sure you walk on water without an issue.

(Menu > Advanced > Settings > set the timer to 100 > Click SAVE)[/HellGround]

[EU Arena-Tournament 4.3.4]Flying seems to be detected on Arena Tournament 4.3.4.

You can bypass their auto-flying-turn-off thingy, by using the flying LOCK, this will be a bit annoying but will allow you to fly at least...

Users suggest spamming presses on the forward key to experience better flying.

If you want REALY smooth flying, try doing the following:
- Mark Flying speed, with the LOCK.
- Press SPACE few times in-game to fly up
- Now turn OFF the lock, go in-game and press and hold 'W' key, dont stop pressing it, move to the sides using the mouse right button. 

If you stop pressing the W it will tag the flying back off.[/EU Arena-Tournament 4.3.4]
[Frostmourne]If you're playing on frostmourne server (frostmourne.eu):

1. All speed altering are detectable - make sure you don't set sped of either flying nor walking or even swimming to more than 7 and you will remain undetected.
If you set speed to more than 7, even just 8, it will alert you that the hacking system suspects your character. REMAIN AT SPEED 7 (100%).

[Frostwolf]Molten-Wow cata realms now detect all speed\teleporting cheats (September 2014) !

You can still fly but avoid having speed of fly\swim\walk higher than 8 - 8.5 or you will risk being detected!
Also, Walk-on-water and walk-under-water, are both detectable, avoid using them on Molten-Wow 4.3.4 realms ![/Frostwolf]
[WoWTemple PvP Server]Almost all hacks are rather detectable on WoW Temple !
However, they seem to simply tag hacks OFF and not ban players, so if you don't care risking it read on ...

Flying hack is possible using the LOCK feature and keeping fly speed at 7 - This should keep you in the air even when server tries to shut off your hack.

Speeds are detected however, and location differences are calculated server-side, therefor not much can be done against that, this includes long-distance teleports.

No Clip, Tracking , Lua, Scale hack, Wall climb, are all all undetected.
No Falling will get tagged off, but not allways. 
Slow fall, instantly detected, avoid using it.[/WoWTemple PvP Server]

[Gamer-District 7x]Game District have flying hacks detected. also teleportation is sometimes detected.

What this means, is that you need to use hacks gently here. Speed hack at around 1000-1500% did not get me detected for more than 25 minutes straight, but Fly hacking for 500% got me banned after 5 minutes, however you can use gravity, wall climb, and teleports without a MAJOR risk, although they do have a detection system so be carfull with it. in any case, hack within reason and you should be fine. (avoid fly-hacking to fast).[/Gamer-District 7x]
